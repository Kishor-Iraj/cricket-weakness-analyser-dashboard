Power BI project: interactive dashboard analyzing batsman dismissal patterns

 üìñ Project Overview
Built a Power BI dashboard that visualizes how different bowlers dismiss batsmen, using historical data:

- Data Source: 2000+ dismissal records in Excel  
- ETL: Power Query Editor transforms and loads data into a 5-table relational model  
- Metrics & Measures: Custom DAX for % dismissals by bowler type, average runs before dismissal, and more  
- Visuals:  
  - Hierarchical slicers for filtering by player, bowler type, and match format  
  - Bar and donut charts showing dismissal breakdowns  
  - Cards for key stats (e.g., highest dismissal rate)

  üìò Case Study

This project analyzes how batsmens are dismissed by different types of bowlers using Power BI.

 Objective
To identify dismissal patterns and weaknesses of cricket players based on historical match data.

Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop  
- Excel (as source data)  
- Power Query (ETL)  
- DAX (for calculations)  

Challenges
- Cleaning inconsistent Excel input formats  
- Creating dynamic slicers across multiple relationships  

Outcome
A fully interactive dashboard with clean filters, cards, charts, and actionable visualizations.
