Power BI project: interactive dashboard analyzing batsman dismissal patterns

 📖 Project Overview
Built a Power BI dashboard that visualizes how different bowlers dismiss batsmen, using historical data:

- Data Source: 2000+ dismissal records in Excel  
- ETL: Power Query Editor transforms and loads data into a 5-table relational model  
- Metrics & Measures: Custom DAX for % dismissals by bowler type, average runs before dismissal, and more  
- Visuals:  
  - Hierarchical slicers for filtering by player, bowler type, and match format  
  - Bar and donut charts showing dismissal breakdowns  
  - Cards for key stats (e.g., highest dismissal rate)
